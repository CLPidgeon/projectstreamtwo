        <header>Spending Increase</header>
        <p>From the net spend chart we can see that there has been a steady increase in net spend from Premier League clubs,
        since 2012 net spending has risen by half a billion Euro from just over 200 million to just over 700 million. </p>

        <header>Transfer Value Groups</header>
        <p>From the row chart we can see that the vast majority of transfers are below 20 million Euro.
        </p>

        <header>Full transfers versus Loans</header>
        <p>This pie chart shows that Premier League clubs rarely dip into the loan market and focus on permanent transfers
            instead.
